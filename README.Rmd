The goal of libminer is to provide an overview of your R library setup.
It is a toy package created as part of a workshop and not meant for 
serious use!

## Installation

You can install the development version of libminer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tbaird80/libminer")
```

## Example

To get a count of installed packages in each of your libraries,
optionally with the total sizes, use `lib_summary()`

```{r example}
library(libminer)
#specify sizes = TRUE
lib_summary(sizes = TRUE)
```
